# Data Scientist Nanodegree
## Data-Science-Capstone-Udacity [Final-Project]

### Summary
By using machine learning methods namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the breed of the dog. We will review a full algorithm to detect the breed of the dog using the given Dataset. We will also see how to use a pre-trained ResNet50 model to use it to detect the breed of the dog.

### Packages Used
Numpy
Sklearn
Keras
Pandas
Matplotlib
